## Overview
We have created a creator platform where any creator can tokenize their content, which will be stored on Filecoin using FEVM, with smart contracts deployed on the FEVM Calibration Testnet.

Creators come to our platform to store exclusive content and launch their NFT collections. Users or their fans can purchase these NFTs to access exclusive content and show support to the creator by buying multiple NFTs.

All transactions are on-chain, thanks to FEVM, and all proceeds from sales go to the creator, which is lacking in Web2.

## Benefits:
1. Content is stored in a decentralized manner.
2. Only NFT holders can access the content, providing creators with better economic opportunities.
3. Creators receive all the revenue earned from NFT sales.
4. Our dapp can earn a minor commission on every sale, making our platform self-sustainable. Currently, it is free.

## Technologies Used:

**FEVM**: Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine, We used FEVM to store data on-chain and, ultimately, to store the content on Filecoin.

**NFT.Storage**: We used NFT.storage for pinning the content and used the metadata for storing the data on-chain.

**WAGMI**: WAGMI was used for connecting wallets and interacting with our smart contract.

**Next.js**: Next.js is used as the frontend framework.

**TailwindCSS**: TailwindCSS is used as the styling framework.

**Viem**: Viem is used as the Ethereum framework for interacting with the smart contract
